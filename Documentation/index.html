            <p>Install by following the steps below:</p>
                  <ol>
         <li>Unzip the package and open up the HTML folder to be able to view the required files. You will have to upload these files (from within the HTML folder) to your hosting service using FTP.</li>
         <br>
         <li>If you want for instance to use <span style="font-weight: bold;">"index-video.html"</span> as your main loading page on your domain you will have to rename it to <span style="font-weight: bold;">"index.html"</span>.</li>
         <br>
         <li>So based on what I said above, you will have to upload only the specific HTML file you want, an <span style="font-weight: bold;">"index.html"</span>.</li>
         <br>
         <li>And that is pretty much it.</li>

      <h3 id="htmlStructure"><strong>B) HTML Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
      <p>This theme was developed with the help of Bootstrap 3, so it uses all the specific Bootstrap elements and structure. The general template structure is similar throughout the template, with only a few exceptions. The code also has included comments so that is going to be helpful for you as well.</p>
      <img src="assets/images/htmlstructure.jpg" alt="HTML Structure" />
      <p style="margin-top:20px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px;"> 1. Changing text colors</span><br> This is simple and you can do it through class targeting. You have a CSS file called <span style="font-weight: bold;">"customization-classes.css"</span>. There you will find all sorts of helpful classes. For instance, you have predefined a few color classes, like <span style="font-weight: bold;"> "color-grey"</span>. Now if you want to change for instance a paragraph you'll just add the specific class like this: </p>
      <img src="assets/images/color-class.png" alt="" />
      <p>You can do this for all the text content. You can add more color classes within the "customization-classes.css" file. <br> Note: For hover/active states of text content you will need to use the general style css file.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="margin-top:20px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px;"> 2. Changing text size</span><br> As previously, you can do it through class targeting, through the <span style="font-weight: bold;">"customization-classes.css"</span> file. You have a few predefined text size classes, but you can change them via the css file, or just add more. Check the file out. For instance an example, if you want to change the size of a paragraph here's how you do it:</p>
      <img src="assets/images/text-size-class.png" alt="" />
      <p>You can do this for all the text content. The section titles' font size is set through the style css though.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="margin-top:20px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px;"> 3. Changing text weight</span><br> As previously, you can do it through class targeting, through the <span style="font-weight: bold;">"customization-classes.css"</span> file. You have predefined text weight classes, and are created based on the used font's existent weights. Check the file out. For instance an example, if you want to change the weight of a paragraph here's how you do it:</p>
      <img src="assets/images/weight-class.png" alt="" />
      <p>You basically add the specific class, which in our case is <span class="weight-bold">"weight-bold"</span>. Check out the specific css file to see the actual classes.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="margin-top:20px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px;"> 4. Adding margins (top, bottom)</span><br> As previously, you can do it through class targeting, through the <span style="font-weight: bold;">"customization-classes.css"</span> file. You have predefined margin classes. Check the file out to see all of them. Here's an example of adding margin top and bottom to a paragraph</p>
      <img src="assets/images/margin-class.png" alt="" />
      <p>You basically add the specific margin class. You can add more if wanted. Check out the specific css file to see the actual classes.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="cssFiles"><strong>C) CSS Files</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
      <p>The theme uses 3 main CSS files that might concern you.</p>
      <ol>
         <li>style.css</li>
         <li>responsive.css</li>
         <li>customization-classes.css</li>
      </ol>
      <p>From within the <span class="weight-bold">style.css</span> file you can change the overall look of the page and you can also change the background images for the specific sections. The video file however is set from within the main HTML file.</p>
      <p>From within the <span class="weight-bold">responsive.css</span> file you can take care of the responsive side of the website. You can do tweaks for that thing if needed.</p>
      <p>From within the <span class="weight-bold">customization-classes.css</span> file you can customize things like text color, text weight, text size, margins, etc. So basically when you want to change the text color, or the text size you simply add the specific class to the item, without having to target the element in CSS.</p>
      <p class="text-italic">Note:<br> The <span class="weight-bold">style.css</span> comes in 9 different versions due to the 3 different pages with 3 different color options. You have the original one for the versions with the static header image. You have the <span class="weight-bold">style-solid-header.css</span> one for the pages with the solid color header. And you have the <span class="weight-bold">style-video.css</span> for the pages with the video header. So there are 3 css files for each version, static, solid header, and video.

      <h3 id="javascript"><strong>D) JavaScript</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
      <p>This theme has some basic functionalities so there aren't that many scripts floating around, only the necessary things.</p>
      <p>So I will just go through what you will have to change.</p>
      <p style="margin-top:20px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px;"> 1. Changing the map location</span><br> Here you will have to open up <span class="weight-bold">js/custom.js</span>. After you opened it up search for <span class="weight-bold">GOOGLE MAP</span> headline comment. There you will have to change the <span class="weight-bold">$latitude</span> and <span class="weight-bold">$longitude</span> accordingly to your location. Once you entered the right values, save it and the map should be updated with your location. The text address can be changed from within the HTML file. You just add your address.</p>
      <p style="margin-top:20px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px;"> 2. Add your email address to the contact form</span><br> Open up <span class="weight-bold">contact.php</span> and add your email address next to <span class="weight-bold">$from</span> and <span class="weight-bold">$SendTo</span>. The same address for both entries. Make sure you use an email based on your domain. Like for instance if your domain is <span class="weight-bold">http://mydomain.com</span> then use an email like <span class="weight-bold">hello@mydomain.com</span>. <br><br>A small note here, as said, if your hosting provider has PHP Mail enabled, and since you have to use a domain related email, you can add a forwarding option to your domain email so you can get your email through services like Gmail. Basically you forward your <span class="weight-bold">"hello@mydomain.com"</span> emails to a Gmail for example. You can do that through your hosting provider's CPanel. </p>
      <p class="weight-bold">PLEASE NOTE<br><span class="weight-regular"> This is a PHP Mail contact form so it will work only if your hosting provider has that option enabled. There are certain providers that turn that off due to spam issues. If your provider turned off the PHP Mail you will need to configure an SMTP mail. SMTP mail option is not included here. The technical requirement for this contact form is PHP >= 5.3</span></p>

      <h3 id="psdFiles"><strong>E) PSD Files</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
      <p>The theme only has 3 psd files for the logo and map marker. </p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="Images"><strong>F) Images</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
      <p>The theme contains 2 stock photos which were edited for a better look and feel. You can change the background images for sections from within the style.css file. You also have 2 videos included. The portfolio images from the demo are not included.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="credits"><strong>G) Sources and Credits</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
      <p>The stock photos and videos are taken from:
      <ul>
         <li>http://splitshire.com</li>
         <br>
         <li>http://www.coverr.co/</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>
      <p>These websites offer stock images/videos which can be used commercially and included in the final pack, so kudos to that.</p>

      <p>Once again, thank you so much for purchasing this theme. As I said at the beginning, I'd be glad to help you if you have any questions relating to this theme. No guarantees, but I'll do my best to assist. It is a simple theme so if you have some basic HTML and CSS knowledge you should be fine editing things out as wanted.</p>
